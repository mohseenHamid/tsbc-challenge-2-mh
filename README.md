# Week 2 Challenge: Working with CSS

## Description

The task was to refactor code to make the webpage more accessible. This was done by incorporating alt image attributes, semantic HTML tags, and refining the overall codebase (HTML + CSS) to make it more strucutred and coherent.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must fulfil the following criteria to meet accessibility standards:

- Semantic HTML elements utilised throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Usage

This is a static webpage that contains a navigation bar in the header. Click on the links to navigate to the respective content sections on the page.

## Mock-Up

- a header containing a page title + navigation bar
